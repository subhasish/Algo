using namespace std;

// Solution:
//			We can use BST to store the students based on GPA.
//			Tie can be broken using the name/roll. This will keep them sorted based on GPA.
//			Now we want to update GPA and have name and new GPA.
//
//			As we donâ€™t have old GPA we might need to do full traversal to get the student based on their name.
//			To do that quickly we need another hash table, which can directly take us to the corresponding entry in the tree.
//
//			See 08.OnlineKMostFrequent.cpp for similar solution.
