 *
 * Problem: Write a program that takes a triangle of numbers (n th row has n entries) and
 * 			returns the minimum weighted path from top to bottom row.
 * 			A path would start from top and descend through adjacent entries in the row below.

// Solution:
//			Consider all cases. So state should be maintained at each cell for the minimum weighted
//			path ending at that cell.
//			Easy as it would be minimum of the two path ending at its adjacent cells in previous row
