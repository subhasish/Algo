// Solution: Making left and right exterior is trivial.
//           Process to make leaves we have seen in last problem in 14.CreateListOfLeaves.cpp
//
// Catch:  Only catch in this problem is while merging these 3 lists that 3 nodes will appear in multiple lists
//         Root will appear in both right and left edge.
//         Corner leaves will appear in both boundaries as well as in leaves.
//
// Not going to implement.
